This is **fun** a app built for [Jscrambler](https://blog.jscrambler.com/) tutorial during the time of pandemic. The objective to include:

- [Expo](https://expo.io) SDK `37.x.x`.
- How to use [Expo font hook](https://github.com/byCedric/use-expo/blob/master/packages/font/docs/use-fonts.md) from [Cedric van Putten's](https://github.com/byCedric) collection of `use-expo` [hooks](https://github.com/byCedric/use-expo).
- How to use [date time picker modal](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker) to select a date.
- Use [momentjs](https://momentjs.com/) to convert the data input provided by the user and calculate the difference between the current date.
